This simple script can be run in your web console.  
Make sure you are on your profile under 'following'.  
Scroll down as far as you wish, then copy/paste this script into the web console.  
It will pause for a random amount of secons seconds between each action in order to not be spammy on the Twitter network.  
Random time varies between 1 and 10 seconds.  
  
### Warning:
#### Do not unfollow more than 300-400 people in a 24 hour period.
Twitter does not like mass unfollowing (or following) and will lock your account.  
To many lock outs and you could get your account banned.

  **Notice:**
  If you want to run this script more than once make sure you reload twitter so the 'non-followers' are off the page. Else this will just reclick and have you refollow everyone you just unfollowed...  
  Also make sure to type the usernames of the non-followers you wish to keep following exacly as is showin in their handle (no need to prefix with '@'.
  
To Do:
1. Make the script unable to refollow previously unfollowed users if the page is not refreshed before consecutive reruns.
2. Let users store any non-followers they wish to keep following in a file for easy re-runs.
3. ~~Allow user to input usernames of non-followers that they wish to keep following.~~
